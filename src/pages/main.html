            <h3 class = "tagline"> <i>"Warthog‚Äôs decentralized network empowers individuals with fair, balanced, and synergized CPU/GPU work. It secures hardcoded DeFi and token technologies, eliminating the risks of smart contracts. Our goal is a safer, more efficient blockchain, aligned with the original vision of cryptocurrency: "one CPU, one vote."</i></h3>
            <span>Warthog network strives to be the most innovative and technological state of the art blockchain in the world. Our mission is to cross-breed innovative approaches into blockchain technology to defend decentralization and bring easy-to-use decentralized finance to the masses.

                We are a relatively young project with the ambitious goals to revolutionize the crypto space by aggressively implementing <b class="lite shadow">features that no other blockchain project can offer</b>: fast and resource-friendly sync by using a thread-based sync model, the world's first Proof of Balanced Work mining algorithm which favors decentralization, nodes which can run and save the chain directly in your browser, and soon also peer to peer communication between browser nodes.
            </span>
            </p>
            </p>
        <span> But there is more: We currently make great progress in solving the Sandwich Problem (front/back running) in DeFi using hard-coded non-smart-contract DeFi and a custom matching engine. This would solve one of the biggest problems of DeFi. In the long run, Warthog shall become a notable player in the DeFi world. Our matching engine shall merge the two different worlds of discrete orders (like in classical exchanges) and continuous liquidity pools. Atomic swaps with other chains are also planned.

        Benefiting from his strong background in mathematics and statistics, CoinFuMasterShifu invented and wrote a paper on the theory of Proof of Balanced Work (PoBW). He also implemented Warthog's revolutionary Janushash mining algorithm (a PoBW algorithm).

        <h3>Polaire</h3> 
        Polaire is helping a lot with miscellaneous things like GitHub actions, testing of new node versions and the website.
        <h3>luk</h3> 
        Luk actively keeps an eye on all warthog-related things and wrote the Warthog Dapp wallet. Warthog also profits from his good connections in the crypto sector.

        M0sh1M0sh1y does a great job at posting news at various social media channels and managing discord related things.
        <h3>andrew</h3> 
        The current blockchain explorer was developed by andrew. He also wrote the GUI wallet.
        <h3>YOU?</h3>
        This is an open source project and everyone is encouraged to contribute.
