                        <p className='paragraph'><strong>"Warthog‚Äôs decentralized network empowers individuals with fair, balanced, and synergized CPU/GPU work. It secures hardcoded DeFi and token technologies, eliminating the risks of smart contracts. Our goal is a safer, more efficient blockchain, aligned with the original vision of cryptocurrency: "one CPU, one vote."</strong></p>
                    <p className='paragraph'> Warthog network strives to be the most innovative and technological state of the art blockchain in the world. Our mission is to cross-breed innovative approaches into blockchain technology to defend decentralization and bring easy-to-use decentralized finance to the masses.
                        We are a relatively young project with the ambitious goals to revolutionize the crypto space by aggressively implementing<strong> features that no other blockchain project can offer</strong>: fast and resource-friendly sync by using a thread-based sync model, the world's first Proof of Balanced Work mining algorithm which favors decentralization, nodes which can run and save the chain directly in your browser, and soon also peer to peer communication between browser nodes.

This would solve one of the biggest problems of DeFi. In the long run, Warthog shall become a notable player in the DeFi world. Our matching engine shall merge the two different worlds of discrete orders (like in classical exchanges) and continuous liquidity pools. Atomic swaps with other chains are also planned.</p>

                <p className='paragraph Keyfacts'>Warthog is a pioneer pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. The following features are exclusive to Warthog.</p>
                <Col>
                    <p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>Chain descriptor based sync<span class="text-icon">üîÅ</span></h2>Experimental new light-weight sync mechanism which requires less network communication and computational resources. For the first time, nodes can understand each other's forks and use this information to sync more efficiently.</p></Col>
                <Col><p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>Proof of Balanced Work<span class="text-icon">‚ö°Ô∏è</span></h2>The world's first algorithm using PoBW concept! Now power of CPU is also important! This brings us closer to Satoshi's original vision of decentralization than ever before since large farms cannot easily join: "one machine one vote"</p></Col>
                <Col><p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>In-browser node<span class="text-icon">üóî</span></h2>Using bleeding edge technology like OPFS and SQLite's recent support for it, we are the world's first cryptocurrency which successfully ported full nodes to the browser - including chain store! Chain is not deleted when you close the browser.</p></Col>

            </Row>
            <Row><h1 className='Keyfacts' style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>UPCOMING REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES</h1>
                
                <Col>
                    <p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>P2P browser nodes<span class="text-icon">üì°</span></h2>Browsers only allow TLS outgoing connections to hosts with a valid domain and certificate. We found a workaround by using WebRTC connections. This way nodes can to be signalled to establish a P2P connection to other browser nodes which greatly increases decentralization.</p></Col>
                <Col><p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>Hard-coded DeFi<span class="text-icon">üí±</span></h2>Up to now DeFi uses smart contracts, nodes don't natively understand DeFi. In contrast, we will hard-code latest DeFi wisdom into the nodes leading to less vulnerabilities, less fees and more convenience and protection against scam techniques like hidden trading fees or supply inflation!</p></Col>
                <Col><p className='REVOLUTIONARY'><h2>Solving DeFi's biggest problem<span class="text-icon">ü•™</span></h2>DeFi is plagued by sandwich attacks and there is no real solution to it - yet. Embedding DeFi as a first-class-citizen allows us to design a custom matching engine in which transaction order does not play a role. This solves DeFi's sandwich problem.</p></Col>
